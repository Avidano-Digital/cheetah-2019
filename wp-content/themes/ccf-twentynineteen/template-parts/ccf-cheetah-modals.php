                        Aurora was brought to CCF as a cub (only several weeks old) in April 2013. A farmer found Aurora without any sign
                        of her mother and kept her for 2 weeks before calling CCF.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When she arrived at CCF her claws had been cut, she was
                        malnourished, and was extremely frightened. Since being at CCF she has been introduced to another female cub,
                        Rainbow, who arrived at CCF around the same time. The two have become companions and now share an enclosure.

                        B2 was rescued in September 2014. He was 5 months old when he was picked up near CCF
                        Headquarters. He was caught in
                        a cage trap on a neighboring farm and he was in good condition.

                    <p>
                        When we picked B2 up he just eaten so we assume that he was with his mother at the time of
                        capture. However, after
                        searching for 3 days straight we were unable to find her and therefore had to bring him in
                        to CCF as he wouldn’t
                        have survived on his on.

                        B2 has since been introduced to Phoenix and they have formed a very strong bond. B2 was
                        named for B2Gold an
                        international mining company that is currently working in Otjikoto, 300 km north of

                        Windhoek between the towns of Otjiwarongo and Otavi.

                        Bella came to CCF in December 2017 and is about a year and a half old. She was kept as a pet on
                        a private farm
                        with a male cheetah, Katiti. After not having permits granted to continue keeping them from the
                        Ministry of
                        Environment and Tourism, the pair were handed over to CCF.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before arriving at CCF, the pair had a poor diet of chicken necks so have been transferred on to
                        a diet of red
                        meat with a vitamin and calcuim supplement to help them grow and develop properly. Bella is very
                        habituated to
                        people and will always purr whenever people are around her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She is confident in nature and is learning quickly during her training sessions at CCF. Both
                        Bella and Katiti
                        are inseparable, spending most of their days together exploring the new enclosures and meeting
                        other cheetahs.
